#[WIP] Workshop: TensorFlow for software engineers.

These are WIP materials for a workshop "TensorFlow for software engineers". It's main goal and purpose is to explain basics of neural networks in computer vision, using a top-bottom approach.
This means we will start with using high-level Keras API from TensorFlow 2.0, learn to train, freeze and export models in a simplest form. Then we will focus on building a simple C++ inference app, using Tensorflow Lite. 

## Starting points
0. Install miniconda/conda
1. Make a new conda env (always do this, never work in global!)
1.1. conda create -n tf python=3.7
2. Install required packages and jupyter stuff
2.1. IpyWidgets and other neat things should be installed already
